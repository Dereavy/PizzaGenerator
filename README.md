# PizzaGenerator
## Shell script that applies a batch of ingredients to their respective random pizza bases.
Generates Random Pizzas
Inspired by my BatchWatermark script

## Description:
 Selects a random pizza from the pizzas folder
 For each ingredient, creates a new random pizza !


## Instructions:
  - Drag script in a folder of your choice
  - Make sure you have installed Imagemagick linked below
  - Run the script (I use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) command prompt) : `/PATH/PizzaGenerator.sh`.
  - The script should generate 2 files: PIZZAS and INGREDIENTS.
  - Place your pizza bases in PIZZAS
  - Place ingredients in INGREDIENTS
  - Run the script a second time, it should place the ingredients on random pizza bases.
